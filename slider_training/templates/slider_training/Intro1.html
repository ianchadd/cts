    <p>
        Your goal is to move the tiles and sort them as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="{% static 'puzzle_goal.png' %}" width='200'/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you begin, follow the three examples below
        to understand how to solve the puzzle.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><u>Example 1</u></strong>:
    </p>
    <p>
        First, consider the following puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="{% static 'puzzle_1.png' %}" width='200'/>
    </p>
   <p>
        You can only move the tiles next to an empty cell and the tile
        you choose is automatically moved to the empty cell.
        For example, in this puzzle there are 3 moves you can do:
        move the tile with the 3 down, move the one with the 5 to the right,
        or move the tile with the 6 up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Between the 3 moves, move the tile with the number 6 upwards
        the only correct move: by moving the 6 up, you can solve the puzzle.
        The other moves do not solve the puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you click on a tile next to an empty cell, the tile
        it will automatically be moved to the empty cell. So, in this
        case, you should click on the 6 to move it up.
